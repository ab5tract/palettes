= Palettes
=== A Simple Interface to Glorious Possiblity
via ab5tract

== History

Palettes began when I saw the butterfly page at colourlovers.com and realized how nice it would be to have a simple
way to get those pretty palettes into an array or hash to use with Cassandra. The initial library just supported some
basic API interaction with ColourLovers. It quickly became apparent that Palettes was destined to become a Waves app,
not to run on a server but as a tool on your own box.

== Present

Palettes has one main feature at this point, which is to fetch palette search results in an easy-to-copy-the-colors
format. This is the Waves interface and can be run with the command 'palettes'.

It's side feature is a quick way to get the colors of colourLovers palettes using the palette ID number.

p = Palettes::ColourLovers.new palette_id
# Hexadecimal color value
p.colors[0].length == 6
=> true

# Colors have names now, represented internally using the format [[name,color], ..]
p = Palettes::ColorLovers.new palette_id, true
p.colors.is_a? Array
=> true
p['this_color'].length == 6
=> true
p.to_hash.is_a? Hash
=> true

== Future

Palettes wants to help. That's why it is growing JavaScript to copy color values to your clipboard in a number of
formats including unnamed arrays and named arrays and hashes. That makes it easy to set up your colors in Cassandra.
Along with this comes AJAX for nicer loading and a few cosmetic features.
Also:
- Palette construction in AJAX
- Support for GregorR's colormatching neural network
- Full ColourLovers API as a secondary feature of the gem
